#1.System to Enchance Weapons and Armor
Allows players to use cool looking gear, vs just high stat bonus. Players use resources in world or from shops. Let's player add DT, add modifiers
to add to CHR or Guns bonus. High science or repair would make players more efficent with materials.

#2.Cryo Damage
Slows you, if there is an extremity, loose an extremity if it gets too cold. 

#3.Armor you can't lift move or shift, but it can be pierced, but you can use powers on it. Shields and barriers are more or less the same. The only real difference is the resistance. 

#4.Percision Strike PER 6 LCK <3
 In VATs you can choose to perform a precision strike, costing 1.5x more action points to do 2x more damage with your selected weapon.
 Crit alternative to for a low luck

#5.Idiot Savant LCK 5 
The lower your intelligence and the higher your luck increases the chance of earning a 5x EXP bonus for 5min. Or if you are within
5-10 of a skill check you can pass it. Or it lowers checks for non speech(barter, intimidate, charm)

.Weapon Motifs
You will find this more often expanded upon in ammunition types, but I wanted to establish some weapon motifs to get a general gist of how the different types of weapons perform based on type. Bullets are precise, wide variety of types. Bolt weapons are weak to sheilds, but heavily strip health at range. Laser ignores shields, but require precise aim/criticals. Plasma strips sheilds/armor, but struggles at range. Incendiary heavily strips health, but does moderate damage to armor and induces burned status effect. Shock heavily strips sheilds, but often lacks range and induces paralysis satus effect. Corrosive heavily strips armor, but does moderate damage to health, but does not induce poision or toxic effects. Sonic ignores armor, sheild, deaily short range high damage to health. 
..Ballistic Weapons Moderate Damage to Health, Moderate Damage to Armor, Moderate Damage to Shields, No Damage To Spirit Barriers. Moderate Melee Damage, Sometimes High. Moderate Recoil. High accuracy. High Velocity. Dual wielded, they suffer accuracy penalty only when both hands are firing. Moderate poise damage. Cheap to produce/purchase. Wide variety of options for most every scenario. Idea is to strip away sheilds with high dps. Otherwise use grenades or melee to strip shields from their opponent and hit a critical area like the head with a precision shot. In close range melee and then aim for a headshot or other critical area, or shot the opponent and follow up with a quick melee. Functionally the opposite of bolt weapons in this regard.

..Bolt Weapons High Damage to Health, Moderate Damage To Armor, Low Damage To Shields, No Damage to Sprit Barriers. High melee damage, High Recoil. Not fletchettes or arrows, unguided rods, typically metal and with an arrow head, has low accuracy. Low velocity, high mass (meaning can push back enemies, vehicles around with physics force), high poise damage (either stun lock enemy very easily or otherwise each attack). When dual wielded, weapons always suffer an accuracy penalty. Unlike fletchettes, these rounds minimally spall on impact. Cheap to produce, though not readily available for purchase. Higher end upgrades, like super heating, look to completely defeat armor. Could be in a smoothbore ballistic weapon, electromagnetic rail, high tension sling. When enemy or even vehicle is close to surface, can pin them to the surface, imbolizing them. Especially brutal on organic enemies though not so much on synthetic enemies. General idea is to use the guns stunning ability to pin an enemy in place and overwhelm their sheilds/armor until their health is brutally crushed. Otherwise make use of grenades, special ammo for armor to defeat at range or at close range begin with a melee attack and finish with the weapon's bolts. If all else fails, the weapons generally heavy a repeated series of melee attacks will suffice. Inflicts damage to user without hearing protection.

..Energy
...The basic principle guiding Laser. Plasma. Incendiary. Cryo. Shock. Corrosive.
...Laser weapons
Low Damage to Health, Low Damage to Armor, Low Damage to Sheilds, High Damage to Spirit Barriers. Added ability of ignoring sheilding and straight going to armor/health. Low Melee Damage, no recoil. Pinpoint Accurate, no mass (meaning no physics force or blunt transfer), low poise damage (very hard to stun lock an opponent.) Instant Velocity (travels at speed of light, hitscan.) When dual weilded, suffer no accuracy penalty when both hands are firing. Expensive to produce, but cheap to purchase. Infinite Range. Idea is for the weapons used to maintain continous bursts of energy otherwise used a sheer overwhelming amount of energy. Great to be first engauging, but terrible to be the last engauging. Exploit the shield ignorance and score critical hits all ranges. Stealth is always lost when firing. Ultimate type of technology to fight spirtual barriered enemies that's normally left to divine/occult forces. Reload failures cause damage to user.
...Plasma weapons
Low Damage to Health, High Damage to Armor, High Damage to Sheilds, Low Damage To Spirit Barriers (decent amount of light generated. Spirit Barriers are indifferent to thermal transfer.) Low Melee Damage (weapons are lightweight in terms of small arms), minimal recoil (idea is that lasers are always no recoil, but plasma weapons have a small amount of recoil due to venting superheated gases, or launching gas capsules that ignite on impact.) When dual weilded, suffer accuracy penalty when both hands are firing. Short range, cannot headshot, expensive to produce and expensive to purchase ammo. Idea is for weapon to dominate up close engagements and weapons often come with alt fire mechanisms which instantly strip shields, deal massive damage to target, disable opponents through EMP. Useless at long ranges or stealth. Make use of grenades when targets disperse to cover or otherwise close in quickly for a melee kill. Somewhat useful against spirit enemies because of light properties, but otherwise an organic/synthetic killer. Reload failures cause damage to user.
...Cryo weapons
Moderate Damage to Health, Low Damage to Armor, Low Damage to Sheilds, No Damage to Spirit Barriers. Moderate Melee Damage (weapons are decently heavy.) Idea is to slow opponent movement, and then freeze them with a frozen status effect for extra follow up damage (especially melee). Additionally, drains target stamina and so even in recovery organic or synthetic targets will struggle to recooperate their mobility. Keeping the enemy pinned so that follow up grenades, or a finishing melee can be applied in cases where cryo falls to freeze target.
...Water Weapons
Moderate damage to Health, No damage to Armor, Low Damage to Sheilds. Penetrate armor in high concentrations of pressure, target's protected well by sheilds. Very rare weapon.
...Incendiary weapons
High Damage to Health, Low Damage to Shields, High Damage to Spirit Barriers. Flammable gases, liquids, gels, composite pastes and dry powders make fleshy, targets, unprotected by sheilds and armor, suffer immensely. Whereas plasma applies immense damage to protection immediately, incendiary applies continious, stacking damage to protection, then health. 

..Corrosive weapons
Moderate Damage to Health, High Damage to Armor, Low Damage to Shields, No Damage to Spirit Barriers. High Melee Damage (often blunt, corrosive vats or capsules heavily increased the weight traditional firarms.) Low recoil, low mass. When dual weilded, suffer no accuracy penalty when both hands are firing. Moderate range. High crtical damage. Expensive to produce, expensive to maintain, expensive to purchase ammo. General idea is to overwhelm the target's defenses with repeated attacks and establish area denial. Whether organic or synthetic, with each attack the target is afflicted with a stacking corrosive damage over time and the non stacking corroded status effect. Attacks against corroding enemies receive a damage bonus, reflecting their weakened state. Corrosive DOT is contagious, with a chance of spreading to afflict adjoining targets. Use of grenades or melee to strip sheild is crucial. While corrosive is not strong against enemy health, once an armored target's shields fall, the attacks will melt through enemy armor and the stacking effects will quickly turn enemies into festering pools of acid. Any misses to target's will generate a small pool of corrosive acid able to iniate, or reiniate the corrosion process. Poison and Toxic effects are usually not inflicted and are in their weapon motif. Reload failures with the weapon will deal a minor amount of corrosive damage to the user and inflict the corroded status effect.

..Chemical weapons
Low Damage to Health, No Damage to Armor, Low Damage to Sheilds, no damage to Spear makersIdea is to stack poison or toxic effects on top of the other. With no real penetrative or defeating properties, damage dealth over time is key.






...Shock weapons
Low Damage to Health, No Damage To Armor, High Damage to Sheilds, Low Damage to Spirit Barriers. Added ability of applying EMP effect build up with each shot and dealing very high posie damage. Moderate Melee Damage, no recoil. Very Poor Accuracy, no mass, but ability to deal high poise damage makes up for not applying physics forces. High Velocity. When dual wielded, suffer no accuracy penalty, however chance to injure self during failed reloads, misfires. Headshots are instant kills. Thorax shots have a moderate chance to kill. Extremely effective at synthetic enemies. Very Short Range, unless uniquely far range. Moderate to produce, high to purchase. Low ammo prices. Idea is to use these weapons to stun opponents, disable enemy synthetics/vehicles, take out large groups of targets indiscriminately without damage surrounding structures. With this weapon type the paralysis status effect can be inflicted. Follow up shots are best done by other weapon types unless at a critical area, or when target cannot escape to cover. Reload failures cause stun to user.
...Pneumatic Projectile
High Damage To Health, Low Damage to Armor, Moderate Damage To Sheilds, No Damage To Spirit Barriers. High melee damage, for while the pneumatic weapons shoot small projectiles, they are often heavy due ot their air tanks providing heavy blunt damage. High Accuracy, low recoil and mass. Deals low poise damage. High velocity projectiles. When dual wielded, weapons always suffer an accuracy penalty. Cheap to produce, very cheap to purchase. Useful more so on organic enemies though not so much on synthetic enemies. General idea is to use the guns near silent sound signature to take out enemies with precisely aimed critical shots. Aummunition is often either small bbs', arrows or bolts. Otherwise make use of grenades/other weapons to whittle down enemy armor. Either stay at range and plink at opponents sheilds with rapid, stealthy attacks or in a pinch, bludgeon them to death with a repeated series of melee attacks will suffice. Misfires are castrophic.
...Sonic Wave
High Damage to Health, No Damage to Armor, No Damage To Sheilds, High Damage to Spirit Barriers. Very Poor Accuracy. Ignores Armor and Sheilds, no mass to slow enemies, but high poise damage. Low Velocity. Whean dual weilded, no accuracy penalty to fire both hands simulataneously. Espensive to produce/cheap to purchase ammo. Very Poor Range. Idea is to use as a very close range weapon simply stripping shields isn't enough or armor is too durable to be penetrated. Mitigated by hearing protection, but still highly adverse to health. Weapons are useless against vehicles or synthetics. Grenades/Melee are optional, but unecessary or useless when used in tandem. 
...Electromagnetic Rail Projectile
High Damage To Health, Moderate Damage to Armor, Moderate Damage To Sheilds, No Damage To Spirit Barriers. High melee damage, but slow. High Accuracy, low recoil, high mass. Deals moderate poise damage. High velocity projectiles. When dual wielded, weapons never suffer an accuracy penalty. Expensive to produce, very expensive to purchase. Useful on organic and synthetic enemies. General idea is to stay at range deliver aimed shots to bring down a target. Electro Magnetic weapons deal great damage against most types of protection and can throw extemely heavy projectiles at high speeds or small projectiles at incredible rates of fire. However, the weapons have the drawback of emp effects on their users in cause of a misfire, or reload failure. Additionally, weapons precison instruments and abuse through melee attack can damage the weapons significantly.

..Spritual Weapons
...Light Weapons
No Damage to Health, No Damage To Armor, No Damage To Shields, High Damage to Sprit Barriers. melee damage, recoil, accuracy, velocity, high mass, high poise damage. When dual wielded, weapons always suffer an accuracy penalty. produce, purchase. Organic, Synthetic, Vehicles. General idea is
...Dark Weapons
High Damage to Health, High Damage To Armor, High Damage To Shields, Low Damage to Sprit Barriers. melee damage, recoil, accuracy, velocity, high mass, high poise damage. When dual wielded, weapons always suffer an accuracy penalty. Complex production. Purchased only on trade/barter, not currency. Organic, Synthetic, Vehicles. General idea is to simple overwhelm their opponent. Dark weapons 




.Sheild Types
Generally shields follow two pattern types, projection amd reactive. They have four main attributes, capacity, recharge rate, delay before recharge, venting. Capacity is defined as the raw amount of energy a sheild is able to maintain. Recharge rate is the amount of energy restored by the battery per second. Delay before recharge is the amount seconds before shields begin recharging. Venting is the method discharge of stored up electrostatic stored up from the sheild systems generator. Sheilds which do not sync which cloaking technology create an intense thermal signature upon impact, discharge, venting or auxilary use of stored electro static.
Dune Shield - Most Primative Shield type, projects simples geometic shapes over a large area. Causes visual distortion to user's vision and to those looking it. Does not fit to the form of its user's armor. Incapable of stopping melee attacks. Can be upgraded to have near infinite capacity, but only moderate recharge rate.
Half Life Shield Armor - Reactive energy shield. Cannot be recharged, must find entire new modules. Does not protect over body/vehilces, layers over exiting armor. Only reduces a degree of imparted weapon/melee energy. Cannot be overcharged, does not sync with cloaking technology.
Half Life Powered Combat Vest - Reactive energy shield. Can be recharged via batteries. Does not protect ovr full body/vehicles, layers over existing armor. Only reduces a defree of imparted weapon/melee energy.
Halfe Life H.E.V. Suit - Reactive energy shield. Can be recharged via batteries. Projects whole body/vehicles, seperate module like Dune Sheild. Only reduces a degree of imparted weapon/melee energy. Not stronger than Powered Combat Vests or Sheild Armor, but can be overcharged beyond capacity (2x).
Mass Effect - Form fitting reactive sheild that does not protect against melee attacks. Slow recharge, accepts high degree of modifications to capacity, recharge rate, venting. Cannot overcharge, but syncs with cloaking technology. 
Stars Wars Republic Commando - Projection-based, form fitting shield that prevents all forms of melee, ballistic, energy damage from affecting its user. Does not cause visual distortion. While weaker than most shields, but sports a very fast internal rechargeble battery. Cannot be overcharged. Does not sync with cloaking technology.
Borderlands - Form fitting reactive sheild types that stop all attacks, but have a variety of options for recharge rate, and unique methods of venting energy discharges. They cannot be synced with cloaking technology, nor overcharged. I removed explosive spike/nova and condensed them down into elemental spike/nova.
 Adaptive - Sheild system anticipates the next impact's material/pattern of spead for increased resistance to elemental damage based on the last type taken.
 Roid - Sheild system stored otherwise vented energy when fully depleted, allows for bonus melee damage to be inflicted in the next following strike.
 Booster - Effectively a shield booster, impacts made upon the sheilds restore energy to a secondary battery when hit. When the sheild capacity is drained completely, the system switches to the auxilary power as its main source. Granting a small sheild boost, the main battery is given further time to refil from drained. Any hits given. 
 Rough Rider - No sheild, increase to health, like Powered Combat Vests it reduces an imparted weapon/melee energy.
 Elemental Spike - Melee attackers take elemental damage when hitting the shield. May reduce or negate corresponding elemental damage (burn, corrode, shock, explosive).
 Elemental Nova - Elemental area damage when depleted; must fully recharge between novas. May reduce or negate corresponding elemental damage (burn, corrode, shock, explosive).
 Turtle - Significantly increased shield capacity, but lowers maximum health.
 Shield - Lower capacity, higher recharge rates, shorter recharge delays.
 Absorb - Chance to absorb bullets that hit the shield. Damage is negated and the bullet is added to the character's stock.
Halo CE - High capacity, form fitting shields, moderate recharge, no health recharge, can be overcharged beyond capacity (4x), syncs with cloaking technology.  Stops all attacks (exept spirit). 
Halo Reach - High capacity, form fitting sheilds, fast recharge, limited health recharge, can be overcharged beyond capacity (4x), syncs with cloaking technology. Stops all attacks (except spirit).
Halo 2, 3, 4, 5 - High capacity form fitting sheilds, very fast recharge, health recharge, can be overcharged beyond capacity (4x), syncs with cloaking technology. Stops all attacks (except spirit).
Crysis 2 (Adative Shield System) - An advanced, multivariant system that utilizes sheild energy. While not as effective as it full suit countpart, this shield system allows the user to switch between different abilities. 
 Maximum Armor - Working much like powered combat vest, the sheild system increases particle density and thus enables total deflection of oncoming high-speed projectiles and melee attacks. However due to the increased density, footsteps are louder and the wearers' stealth properties are significantly reduced if operating on certain terrains, such as concrete or brick. A prominent glow will flow through the systems' lattice as it channels power-dampening energy. The sheild, like with all adaptive sheild system sub types, drains the energy over time. While not as potent as an overcharge, consistent recharge rates and solid protection make this a prolific, if less powerful alternative.
 Cloak - Sheild system diverts energy to an attached cloaking sub system. Utilizing the shield's own projected lattice the cloaking makes wearer near fully transparent. In addition, the concentration of sheild energy at hands and feets traps most vibrations (sound) produced by movement. Firing a shot from an unsuppressed ballistic or energy weapon while cloaked will fully overwhealm the shield's projection, revealing the wearer. The same occurs with melee attacks, picking up an item/enemy or generally moving too fast. While not as stable an independent cloaking module, this more than enough provides an ample alternative.
 Maximum Power - Utilize the energy venting and power supply of the sheild system to concentrate energy at one's hands and feet to deliver brutal, powerful melee attacks. Additionally, this force applies to throw objects, including enemies.
 Maximum Speed - Utilize the energy venting and power supply of the sheild system to concentrate energy at one's hands and feet to quickly sprint across open ground, mantle across obstacles, and jump higher. consumes energy when performing fast actions such as a "power jump," "power sprint," or "power slide," moving an incredibly vast and cumbersome object, or crashing down on a surface or enemy with titanic force (known as an "air stomp").

.Sprit Barriers
Directly protective to magic/miracle attacks, these metaphysical form of sheilds are only taken down naturally through light/dark spirtiual properties found in natural phenomina. Hence, energy weapons like lasers that casts light over their targets can damage enemies. However, ballistic weapons cannot.

.Backpack Types
Armor Ability Modules
These types o
ECM Jammer - Prevents the triggering of remote detonated explosives (C4 prime example), scrambles personal radars/motion trackers, navigation maps in a certain radius.
Armor Lock - Creates an overcharged, temporary invulnerable sheild overlay. However locks the user in for their use. 
Concussion - Deliver an immediate concussive blast in the surrounding area. Turning oneself into a walking stun grenade that staggers enemies.
Jetpack - Ascend and soar across open air to more slowly move vertically.
Jumpback - Jump a far distance by boosting onself high into the sky.
Thruster Pack - Provides a quick lateral burst of speed, allowing the wearer to quickly move to the front, back, left, right. Effective to dodge incoming projectiles or dart into cover.
Fleetfoot - Increase normal speed of mantle, sprint, swim or slide.
Active Camo - Cloak onself in a translucent field, effectively making one invisible.
Vision - Power up advanced thermal googles linked to communications network and see people through objects/terrain.
Heal - On board medical suite that is able to administer first aid and medical attention to oneself or otherwise in their radius.
Rhino - Charge through solid walls, destroying them with intense force and protecting oneself from harm for a few seconds.
Tremor - Unleash violently shockwaves to destroy structures and natural obstructions.

/// Small steel bb's encased in a thin Kelvar bag, these rounds are limited to their application 
Bean bag rounds are less-than-lethal shotgun ammunition commonly used by law enforcement to quell riot situations. Bean bags inflict Fatigue Damage and stun a target momentarily. For soft targets, bean bag rounds can still drain their health and kill them with multiple shots.
/// . Rubber
/// . Hammerhead Rounds
/// Oblong ammunition that niether fragements nor severely crushes upon impactm these rounds form a tough super structure at the edge's of thier core's impact. While not offering more than marginal armor pentrating capabilties, the ammunition transfers all stored energy into kinetic force to its target. Effectively pushing the target, continous or simultaneous use of the ammunition can stun opponents and even knock them flat on their back.

/// +90% DMG to organics
/// . High Explosive
/// Instead of relying on mass and velocity, these rounds use chemical reactions to
/// penetrate armor. Unaffected by velocity penalities, these rounds have the same
/// pentration over all distances. However, this leads the ammunition to never
/// overpentrate as the ammunition explodes upon impact. Offering no pentrative
/// capabilities this round defeats its target's armor with the use of high explosives and
/// otherwise deals massive overpressure from compressed air shockwaves. 
/// DAM 5x, DTx1, +100% Explosive Damage, 1x Condition, 1x Spread, +500% blunt damage transfer
/// . High Explosive Timed Fuse
/// Instead of relying on mass and velocity, these rounds use chemical reactions to
/// penetrate armor. Unaffected by velocity penalities, these rounds have the same
/// pentration over all distances. However, this makes the round easy to defeat by cover.
/// Traditionally used as a anti aircraft round, this type of high explosive round works
/// off of a timed fuse rather than explode on impact. Functionally the same as it non

/// Designed to overcome the high impact, high caliber ammunition, this armor acts with chemical fibers to contract around zones of impact. Increasing its effectiveness against single shot, large rifle rounds, this armor was widely adopted by wealthy nation seeking to help their soldiers survive even small bursts of enemy machine gun fire. Sadly, it is overcome by overloading its chemical states with high volumes of fire. Even long bursts of small pistol caliber ammo with will open its wearer to a momentary lapse in protection, able to be exploited by a quick follow up high caliber round. Worse still, tempature based, direct energy weapons completely negate the effectiveness of the system. Despite such pitfalls the armor remains popular especially in units combating scouting parties and entrenched sniper sentries.
