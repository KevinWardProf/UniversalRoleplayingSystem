Systems (#8.#11.#12.)

#1.System to Enchance Weapons and Armor
Allows players to use cool looking gear, vs just high stat bonus. Players use resources in world or from shops. Let's player add DT, add modifiers
to add to CHR or Guns bonus. High science or repair would make players more efficent with materials.

#2.Cryo Damage
Slows you, if there is an extremity, loose an extremity if it gets too cold. 

#3.Armor you can't lift move or shift, but it can be pierced, but you can use powers on it. Shields and barriers are more or less the same. The only real
difference is the resistance. 

#4.Percision Strike PER 6 LCK <3
 In VATs you can choose to perform a precision strike, costing 1.5x more action points to do 2x more damage with your selected weapon.
 Crit alternative to for a low luck

#5.Idiot Savant LCK 5 
The lower your intelligence and the higher your luck increases the chance of earning a 5x EXP bonus for 5min. Or if you are within
5-10 of a skill check you can pass it. Or it lowers checks for non speech(barter, intimidate, charm)

/// <summary> Ammunition Types
/// 1. Hand Loaded Ammunition
/// Ammo crafting via a reloading bench allows players to take existing ammunition and
/// convert it into their favored ammunition recipes. Custom Ammunition takes this a step
/// further and allows players to fine tune their ammunition. While at first simply
/// making marginal resources gains, late investment means creating the perfect ammunition /// for the right weapon. Hand Loaded Custom Ammunition is found no where in the game.
/// . Armor Piercing
/// Armor Piercing ammunition is designed for punching through armor plating and for this
/// purpose, they have a greatly strengthened case with a specially hardened core and
/// shaped nose. Due to the high velocity and penetrative properties of the round, the
/// limited expansion.
/// DMG x0.90, -15 DT, Condition X1, Spread X1, +15% DMG to Synthetics
/// . Armor Piercing Capped
/// Like traditional Armor Piercing ammunition this type is designed for defeating armor
/// plating, however its softer metal, rounded nose transfers impact shock away from the 
/// tip to prevent shattering. Deforming on impact, the trajectory of the round rotates to /// form a smaller angle, improving penetration on angled armor.
/// DAM x0.90, -20 DT, Condition x1, Spread x1, +15% DMG to Sythetics, -30% ammo velocity
/// . Armor Piercing Ballistic Capped
/// Shaped with the same softer material as APC ammo, the nose on this ammunition is
/// molded for improved aerodynamics. Overcoming the velocity pitfalls of APC the ammo,
/// doesn't add any additional penetration directly. Instead the round improves
/// performance at longer distances and explodes upon impact.
/// DAM x0.90, -15DT, Condition x1, Spread 1x, +15% DMG to Synthetics, +30% velocity
/// . Armor Piercing Capped Ballistic Capped
/// Combining the nose cone of the Armor Piercing Capped and the ballistic cap of the
/// Armor Piercing Capped Ballistic Capped, this round provides the best of worlds.
/// Offering increased penetration and velocity without sacrificing
/// DAM x0.90, -20DT, Condition x1, Spread 1x, +15% DMG to Sythethics, +30% Velocity
/// . Armor Piercing High Explosive
/// Armor Piercing ammunition with iternal explosive filler on the inside. After pentrating armor, a timed fused actives the explosives dealing additional damage on top of the physically pentrating projectile.
/// DAM x0.90, -10DT, Conditiond x1, Spread 1x, +15% DMG to Sythethics, +10% DMG to
/// Organics, +10% Explosive Damage
/// . Armor Piercing High Explosive Capped
/// DAM x0.90, -15DT, Conditiond x1, Spread 1x, +15% DMG to Sythethics, +10% DMG to
/// Organics, +10% Explosive Damage, -30% Velocity
/// . Armor Piercing High Explosive Ballistic Capped
/// DAM x0.90, -10DT, Conditiond x1, Spread 1x, +15% DMG to Sythethics, +10% DMG to
/// Organics, +10% Explosive Damage, +30% Velocity
/// . Armor Piercing High Explosive Capped Ballistic Capped
/// DAM x0.90, -15DT, Conditiond x1, Spread 1x, +15% DMG to Sythethics, +10% DMG to
/// Organics, +10% Explosive Damage, +30% Velocity
/// . Anti Concrete
/// Designed as an anti-enmplacement round to be used against fortifications like
/// pillboxes, bunkers. Functioncally the same as Armor Piercing High Explsoive, the round /// fired has a greater amount of explosive filler without sacrificing pentration.
/// DAM x0.90, -15DT, Conditiond x1, Spread 1x, +15% DMG to Sythethics, +10% DMG to
/// Organics, +30% Explosive Damage
/// . Tungsten
/// Specifically designed to puncture metal, these rounds are particularly effective
/// against synthetic targets and vehicles. Made of smaller rounds designed to be fired at /// higher speeds that do not expand, these rounds tend to overpenetrate soft flesh and
/// continue onward.
/// DMG x1, -30 DT, %40 damage to Synthetics, -10% DMG to Organics
/// .Armor Piercing Composite Rigid
/// Instead of the entire shell, these rounds use small and dense cores as pentrators. Due
/// to the size of the cores, it can focus all expended energy into a small area upon
/// deformation leading to immense pentration. Due to a lack of spalling, this round has
/// no after pentration effects. When defeated by armor, the round fragments and shatters
/// before delivering heavily reduced blunt force trauma.
/// DAM x0.85, -20DT, Condition x1, +10% Velcoity, -30% blunt damage transfer
/// . Armor Piercing Discarding Sabot
/// Instead of the entire shell, these rounds use small, dense arrow-like cores as
/// pentrators. Discarding a soft casing called a sabot after exiting the barrel, it can
/// focus all expended energy into a small area upon deformation leading to immense
/// pentration. Made out of a tougher tungsten alloy, the core is less susceptible to
/// shattering upon tougher armor, but has no after penetration effects.
/// DAM x0.85, -25DT, Condition X1, +35% Velocity, -10% blunt damage transfer
/// . Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot
/// Like Armor Piercing Discarding Sabot, this tungestun cored sabot is designed to focus
/// all expended energy into a small area upon deformation leading to immense pentration.
/// The core, made from depeleted uranium, leading the core to deform and self sharpn upon
/// impact. Additionally depeleted uranium is pyrophoric, igniting upon impact and melting
/// armor. The round is less susceptible to shattering upon tougher armor and even provides
/// smaller spalling effects to its target.
/// DAM x0.85, -28DT, Condition X1, +35% Velocity, +5% DMG to Sythetics, +5% DMG to
/// Organics, +5% Fire Damage, Armor 1.3X, -10% blunt damage transfer
/// . Shrapnel
/// A thin metal casing surrounds a stack of metal balls, backed by a detonator at the
/// rear. When pentrating the detonator actives, spewing shrapnel all over the target's
/// internals.
/// DMG x1, -5DT, +10% DMG to Synthetics, +40% DMG to Organics, +30% Explosive Damage
/// . Hollow Point
/// Hollowpoint bullets mushroom and break upon impact, causing massive trauma on fleshy, /// unarmored targets. However, this also means they break up easily when they hit armor
/// plates, drastically reducing the weapon's penetrating power.
/// DAM 1.75x, DT x3,  Condition x1.5, Spread x1, +15% DMG to Organics
/// Jacketed Soft Point
/// Designed with a semi-jacketed harder metal coating with a soft bullet tip. It offers
/// evenly managed damage and penetrative power. This round will do more damage than armor
/// piercing rounds and hollow point rounds in most situations making it the best all-round
/// ammo.
/// DAM 1.5x, DT x1, Condition x1.5, Spread x1, 10% DMG to Organics, 10% DMG to Synthetics
/// . Jacketed Flat Points
/// Blunt, copper-wrapped bullets designed to flatten on impact like a hollow point, but
/// retain the penetrating power of a copper-jacket slug. 
/// DAM 1.25,x -3DT, Condition 1x, Spread 0.8x, +10% DMG to Organics
/// . Special Low Load Round
/// A less powerful cartridge, this round can be fired from any weapon capable of firing  /// the regular round. Despite the name, they share all the same dimensions except case
/// length and a tougher cap. Though the reduction in powder means less force inflicted on
/// the target, it also means less wear and tear per shot on the gun. A cost effective
/// option for those short on powder and want roughly the same effect.
/// DAM 0.75x, -2DT, Condition 0.75x, Spread 1x, -15% bullet velocity, -10% blunt damage
/// transfer, -10%, -5% Recoil
/// . Semi Wad Cutter
/// This flat-nosed bullet traditionally sits pointing down the barrel of revolvers. An all
/// purpose compromise, this round combines the benefits of traditional round nose bullets
/// and wadcutters common in hunting, target shooting and plinking. Rather than
/// tearing/stretching like its rounded counterparts, this round punches a clean hole
/// through its target. Holding together on impact, the round maintains shape with minimal
/// expansion, creating an air envelope for greater cavitation and wounding. Without the
/// feeding issues found in full wade cutters in, this round additionally mitigates recoil,
/// but suffers from additional fouling upon inigition.
/// DAM 1.2x, -6DT, Condition x3, Spread x1, -10% recoil, -5% jam chance
/// . Shredder Rounds
/// Designed to shred flesh and other organic matter, these rounds eviserate  
/// DAM 2.75x, DT x6,  Condition x1.5, Spread x1, %40 damage to Organics, -10% DMG to
/// Synthetics
/// . Flechette
/// Typically favored in the context of shotguns, these rounds have had their traditional
/// ballistic cores replaced with tiny, sharp metal darts. Great for armor penetration, but
/// suffering from a reduction in blunt force, these low velocity rounds soar true with the
/// help of stabilizing fins. Often spalling upon impact these rounds are not fragible upon
/// impact. Maintaining their shape, they pierce their target in a narrow spread of
/// pinpoint penatrators. Often encased in their a type of marking powder, it is readily
/// apparent where the shooter has landed their hits.
/// DAM 0.9x, -22DT,  Condition x1, Spread x0.8, -30% Velocity, %30 damage to Organics, -10% DMG to Synthetics, -10% Blunt transfer force, +2 PER to User, -2 PER in target


/// . Beanbag Rounds
/// Small steel bb's encased in a thin Kelvar bag, these rounds are limited to their application 
Bean bag rounds are less-than-lethal shotgun ammunition commonly used by law enforcement to quell riot situations. Bean bags inflict Fatigue Damage and stun a target momentarily. For soft targets, bean bag rounds can still drain their health and kill them with multiple shots.
/// . Rubber
/// . Hammerhead Rounds
/// Oblong ammunition that niether fragements nor severely crushes upon impactm these rounds form a tough super structure at the edge's of thier core's impact. While not offering more than marginal armor pentrating capabilties, the ammunition transfers all stored energy into kinetic force to its target. Effectively pushing the target, continous or simultaneous use of the ammunition can stun opponents and even knock them flat on their back.
/// DAM x5.5x, -1DT, Condition X1, -5% Velocity, +5% DMG to Sythetics, +5% DMG to
/// Organics, +90% blunt damage transfer

/// Sledgehammer Rounds
///  Squash projectiles which flatten on impact knock opponents completely off their feet. Coated with polonium to induce radiation sickness in targets(toxic damage?). Trade off for increased heat absorption.
/// DAM x0.85, -28DT, Condition X1, +35% Velocity, +5% DMG to Sythetics, +5% DMG to
/// Organics, +5% Fire Damage, Armor 1.3X, +30% blunt damage transfer

/// . Harpoon Rounds
/// Harpoon Rounds are built of material condenses on impact to pentrate armor, then
/// shreds into shrapnel upon entering the softer medium of flesh. Combining the best of
/// both traditional armor-piercing and hollow point ammunition, this ammunition is
/// considered highly unethical.
/// Req: Guns 90
/// DMG x1.90, -30 DT, Condition x1, Spread x1, -100 Karma per kill, -15% DMG to sythetics
/// +90% DMG to organics
/// . High Explosive
/// Instead of relying on mass and velocity, these rounds use chemical reactions to
/// penetrate armor. Unaffected by velocity penalities, these rounds have the same
/// pentration over all distances. However, this leads the ammunition to never
/// overpentrate as the ammunition explodes upon impact. Offering no pentrative
/// capabilities this round defeats its target's armor with the use of high explosives and
/// otherwise deals massive overpressure from compressed air shockwaves. 
/// DAM 5x, DTx1, +100% Explosive Damage, 1x Condition, 1x Spread
/// . High Explosive Timed Fuse
/// Instead of relying on mass and velocity, these rounds use chemical reactions to
/// penetrate armor. Unaffected by velocity penalities, these rounds have the same
/// pentration over all distances. However, this makes the round easy to defeat by cover.
/// Traditionally used as a anti aircraft round, this type of high explosive round works
/// off of a timed fuse rather than explode on impact. Functionally the same as it non
/// timed counterpart, unless used in connjuction with a rangfinding device its
/// effectiveness is limited. Useful in cases where an explosive needs to be deployed at a
/// particular time and place, this round explodes only when its timer detonates. Can be
/// used as an impromptu landmine or delayed attack. 
/// DAM 5x, DTx1, +100% Explosive Damage, 1x Condition, 1x Spread
/// . High Explosive Anti Tank
/// . High Explosive Variable Timed
/// Instead of relying on mass and velocity, these rounds use chemical reactions to
/// penetrate armor. Unaffected by velocity penalities, these rounds have the same
/// pentration over all distances. However, this makes the round easy to defeat by cover.
/// An improved version of the High Explosive Timed Fuse, with a variable fuse this round
/// is able to detect when its own distance to its target. As a result accuracy is far
/// less important and the round explodes within a certain distance of its target. Highly
/// effective against aircraft, these round see niche deployments against ground targets
/// in cases where targets must be stuck behind cover.
/// DAM 5x, DTx1, +100% Explosive Damage, 1x Condition, 1x Spread
/// . High Explosive Grenade
/// Instead of relying on mass and velocity, these rounds use chemical reactions to
/// penetrate armor. Unaffected by velocity penalities, these rounds have the same
/// pentration over all distances. However, this makes the round easy to defeat by hard
/// surfaces. Specifically designed to be fire from recoiless rifles. Due to their often
/// unconventional charges and weight distributions, this round suffers a velocity penalty.
/// DAM 5x, DTx1, +100% Explosive Damage, 1x Condition, 1x Spread, -50% Velocity
/// . Fragmentation Explosive Round
/// Instead of relying on mass and velocity, these rounds use chemical reactions to
/// penetrate armor. Unaffected by velocity penalities, these rounds have the same
/// pentration over all distances. However, this makes the round easy to defeat by hard
/// surfaces. Utitlizing fragmenting casings, the round deals an explosive, concussive
/// force and then hits its target, whether internally or external, with a storm of
/// fragmentation. Inducing heavy bleeding in an organic target, this round is designed to
/// be used against organics. Useful to destory vegetation, soft cover, armored tracks,
/// barrels.
/// DAM 5x, DTx1, +100% Explosive Damage, 1x Condition, 1x Spread, +100% Bleed
/// . Rocket
/// Instead of relying on mass and velocity, these rounds use chemical reactions to
/// penetrate armor. Unaffected by velocity penalities, these rounds have the same
/// pentration over all distances. However, this makes the round easy to defeat by hard
/// surfaces. An unguided, self propelling high explosive round, this round soars towards
/// its target and detonates upon impact.
/// DAM 5x, DTx1, +100% Explosive Damage, 1x Condition, 1x Spread, +100% Velocity
/// High Explosive Squash Head
/// Instead of relying on mass and velocity, these rounds use chemical reactions to
/// penetrate armor. Unaffected by velocity penalities, these rounds have the same
/// pentration over all distances. However, this makes the round easy to defeat by hard
/// surfaces. Using a different type of explosive filler made of plastic, this round uses
/// the target's armor against itself.   
/// DAM 5x, DTx1, +100% Explosive Damage, 1x Condition, 1x Spread, +100% Velocity
/// Incendiary Rounds
///     --Incendiary / Inferno Rounds
///     Consist of a thermite paste which clings to, and burns through nearly any known substance.
/// Cryo Rounds
///     --Cryo Rounds
///     Cooling Lasers collapse ammunition into small Bose-Einstein condensate - a mass of super-cooled subatomic particles - capable of snap-freezing impacted objects
///     --Snowblind Rounds
///     Inflict massive damage and destabilize enemies, reducing their accuracy. Reduces Enemy Accuracy, Rate of Fire of Weapon, Deals extra damage
///     --Snap Freeze?
///     Slow movement, reflexive times.
/// Explosive Rounds
///     --High Explosive
///     Detonate on Impact, has Blast Radius, generates a lot of heat, weapon physics force, and has a damage bonus
/// Shield Piercing Ammunition

/// . Pepperball
/// . Poison Dipped
/// Often nothing more than standard leaded full metal jakcet or even more advanced armor
/// piercing/hollow point rounds with a small dose of hazardous compounds, ammunition like
/// this remains something of a myth. Confined to great tales of Shakespearean drama,
/// sensationalist fears of hunting gone awry and dark tales of no name, government
/// assassins, poison inflicting ammos remain a shunned and often ill effective choice.
/// Sacrificing realibility and causing great fouling, these rounds dipped in naturally
/// occuring animal poisons, simple compound mixtures or even human feces can taint even the
/// hardiest of organic targets. Dealing a passively increasing damage over time upon status
/// infliction, the rounds offer no benefits to dealing with synthetic or heavily armored
/// foes. Only by striking hardened organic foes in vulnerable spots can the rounds continue
/// build. Despite this, poisions are a great way to stop the healing of targets or give a
/// slight edge in dynamic exchanges of fire.
/// DAM x1, DT x1, Condition X1.2, 1x Spread, +15% DMG to Organics, 55% Poison Damage -50
/// Karma Per Kill
/// . Toxic Manufactured
/// Specialized rounds constructed with sub compartments or internal air pockets for mixing, these rounds induce sickness into targets with deadly artificial toxins, violatile chemical mixtures and designed viruses. Popular with those never intending legal behavior, these rounds are heavily looked down upon. 
/// DAM x1, DT x1, Condition X1.2, 1x Spread, +15% DMG to Organics, 55% Poison Damage -75 /// Karma Per Kill
///     --Polonium Round
///     Stamped with miniscule amount of radioactive polonium into every round, poisioning enemy targets and preventing enemy health regeneration.
/// Anti-Tech?
///     --Radioactive Rounds
///     Radioactive materials induce low level radition sickness in targets, reducing cooldown rates for ability uses.

/// . 
/// . Depleted Uranium Disacarding Sabot
/// Known by many names, D.U.D.S, Black Tips, Demon Rounds, Darkstar Bullets, this rare,
/// experimental ammunition offers a tightly compacted load, laced with alpha ray emitting
/// radioloical material. Made with a plastic buffer between the round and powder, the
/// compression on the round's primer reduces chances for misfire with the obvious hazard of
/// explosive, radioligcal particles entering the user's airways. Very similar to it's Armor
/// Piercing Discarding Sabot cousin, this round throws all of its core's mass into a small
/// area upon deformation leading to deep pentration. Self sharpening upon impact, this
/// pyrophoric, depleted uranium core, ignites upon impact, melting armor and spalling in
/// it's target's interior. While this round is less susceptible to shattering upon tougher
/// armor, it offers less capability as the round intends to induce poisioning in its
/// target. Due to this, the unranium oxide produced upon firing, though minute, is a hazard
/// and use in high rate of weapons may inflict sever radition poisioning in the user.
/// DAM x0.95, -25DT, Condition X0.50, +35% Velocity, +15% DMG to Sythetics, +40% DMG to
/// Organics, +5% Fire Damage, +5% Toxic Damage, +55% Radiological Damage, -15% jam chance,
/// -10% blunt damage transfer, STR > 7 to dismantle, -150 Karma per kill
/// . Deleted Uranium Fletchette Fin Stabalized Sabot
/// A flechette conterpart to the depleted unranium discarding sabot round, these tiny metal
/// arrows sit snug inside of a unique casing. This highly advanced housing is made of a
/// nylon, glass composite hybrid material that pulls the fletchettes along the barrel of
/// the weapon at hyper velocity. Spewing a group of unranium nails at velocities higher any
/// traditional armor piercing or hollow pointed ammunition, the self sharpening arrows
/// throw their force across a small area of effect. Deforming in multiple, molten points of
/// ignition, the fletchettes spall into their target's interior while also dealing great
/// amounts of radiological poisioning. Sadly due to their finely-tuned and complex nature,
/// rounds of this manufacture have more vectors of misfires. No greater safety against
/// misfires is in their construction. Less susceptible to shattering upon tougher
/// armor, the unranium oxide produced upon firing, though minute, is a hazard
/// and use in high rate of weapons may inflict severe radition poisioning in the user.
/// DAM x0.95, -31DT, Condition X1.1, +95% Velocity, +15% DMG to Sythetics, +40% DMG to

/// . Dragonskin
/// Designed to overcome the high impact, high caliber ammunition, this armor acts with chemical fibers to contract around zones of impact. Increasing its effectiveness against single shot, large rifle rounds, this armor was widely adopted by wealthy nation seeking to help their soldiers survive even small bursts of enemy machine gun fire. Sadly, it is overcome by overloading its chemical states with high volumes of fire. Even long bursts of small pistol caliber ammo with will open its wearer to a momentary lapse in protection, able to be exploited by a quick follow up high caliber round. Worse still, tempature based, direct energy weapons completely negate the effectiveness of the system. Despite such pitfalls the armor remains popular especially in units combating scouting parties and entrenched sniper sentries. Additionally, appearing in armor pieces for parts of the body too small to be weighted down by convential plating.
