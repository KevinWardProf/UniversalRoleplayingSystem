#1.System to Enchance Weapons and Armor
Allows players to use cool looking gear, vs just high stat bonus. Players use resources in world or from shops. Let's player add DT, add modifiers
to add to CHR or Guns bonus. High science or repair would make players more efficent with materials.

#2.Cryo Damage
Slows you, if there is an extremity, loose an extremity if it gets too cold. 

#3.Armor you can't lift move or shift, but it can be pierced, but you can use powers on it. Shields and barriers are more or less the same. The only real
difference is the resistance. 

#4.Percision Strike PER 6 LCK <3
 In VATs you can choose to perform a precision strike, costing 1.5x more action points to do 2x more damage with your selected weapon.
 Crit alternative to for a low luck

#5.Idiot Savant LCK 5 
The lower your intelligence and the higher your luck increases the chance of earning a 5x EXP bonus for 5min. Or if you are within
5-10 of a skill check you can pass it. Or it lowers checks for non speech(barter, intimidate, charm)
